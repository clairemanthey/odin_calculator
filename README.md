## Introduction
Welcome to my Calculator project. This project is the final project from The Odin Project [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations). It brings together all the concepts taught in the Foundations course to create a functional calculator with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, that will take in user input and output the correct answer. 
 
The project included features beyond being able to compute basic mathematical operations. Those features are adding both a clear and backspace button. A floating decimal, allowing the user to enter a decimal point. The mathematical operations are done in the order the user enters them and not in the order of operations.


## Motivation
I began The Odin Project’s Foundations Course to review my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, as well as see if there were any concepts I had previously missed. I wanted to gain more experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application.
